# Identikit 2

[Identikit 2](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/barnes/research/identikit/index.html) by [Joshua Barnes](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/barnes/) ([github](https://github.com/joshuabarnes/)).

This is a copy with minor modifications by George Privon:

* dynamically rescale the xy offset to compensate for changes in the scale factor.
* hack/workaround to the body selection to facilitate display of bulgeless galaxy simulations.
